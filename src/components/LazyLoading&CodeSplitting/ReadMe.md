Lazy loading and code splitting are two optimization techniques used to improve the performance of web applications by reducing the initial load time


Scope:

** Lazy Loading: Applies to individual resources or components.

** Code Splitting: Applies to the entire codebase, breaking it into smaller bundles.



Purpose:

** Lazy Loading: Delays the loading of specific resources until they are needed.

** Code Splitting: Breaks the application into smaller chunks to reduce the initial bundle size and load parts of the application as needed.


Implementation:

** Lazy Loading: Often used with specific components or resources.

**Code Splitting: Typically used with routing to load different parts of the application on demand.


Combined Approach

** For many applications, a combined approach works best. Use code splitting in App.tsx to handle different routes and major sections, and apply lazy loading within individual components to further optimize specific parts of the application.
