// !üîπ 1. Architecture & System Design (Frontend-Specific)

//? How do you architect a scalable React/Next.js application for thousands/millions of users?

// * 1 ‚Äî Project Structure Organize by features, not layers: This keeps the codebase modular and scalable for teams.

// /src
//   /features
//     /auth
//       components/
//       hooks/
//       services/
//     /profile
//     /dashboard
//   /components      # shared UI (buttons, modals, etc.)
//   /hooks           # reusable React hooks
//   /lib             # utils, API client, constants
//   /store           # global state management
//   /styles          # theme, global CSS/Tailwind config

//*  2 ‚Äî State Management

// Local state: React‚Äôs useState, useReducer for component-scoped UI.

// Global state: Only when needed (auth, theme, playback, cart).

// Lightweight ‚Üí Zustand or Jotai.

// Large teams / complex apps ‚Üí Redux Toolkit.

// Server state:

// Use React Query (TanStack Query) or SWR for fetching/caching.

// Handles retries, deduping, cache invalidation.

// * 3 - Can you explain how you handled performance optimizations (lazy loading, code splitting, caching, bundle optimization)?

// üìã React Scaling Checklist
// ‚úÖ Organize code by feature ‚Üí easy to scale.
// ‚úÖ Keep local vs global state separate (Zustand/Redux + React Query).
// ‚úÖ Add code splitting + list virtualization.
// ‚úÖ Centralize design system with Storybook.
// ‚úÖ Monitor errors & performance in production.
// ‚úÖ Automate tests + lint + performance checks in CI/CD.
// ‚úÖ Use error boundaries and skeleton loaders for resilience.

//? -  How do you ensure maintainability and reusability in large React/Next.js projects?

// üìã Quick Checklist
// ‚úÖ Organize by feature folders, not giant /components.
// ‚úÖ Use custom hooks for logic reuse.
// ‚úÖ Keep UI + state separate (local/global/server).
// ‚úÖ Centralize styling with a design system + theme tokens.
// ‚úÖ Document reusable parts with Storybook.
// ‚úÖ Enforce standards with ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript.
// ‚úÖ Automate tests + bundle analysis in CI/CD.
// ‚úÖ Encourage small, composable components ‚Üí not monoliths.

// üëâ Preparation: Practice explaining folder structures, state management choices (Zustand/Redux), CI/CD setup for frontends, and performance metrics (TTFB, FCP, Lighthouse).

//! üîπ 2. Leadership & Mentorship

// ‚ÄúLed‚Äù implies you‚Äôve guided people.
// Possible questions:

//? Tell me about a time you mentored or onboarded a junior developer.

//* Situation:
// At Wema Bank, our frontend team grew quickly, and we brought on a junior developer who was fresh out of school. He had solid JavaScript basics but wasn‚Äôt familiar with React best practices, Git workflows, or working in a large codebase.

//* Task:
// My responsibility was to help him get productive quickly, understand our project structure, and follow our standards so his contributions wouldn‚Äôt cause regressions.

//* Action:

// I started by walking him through our project architecture (feature-based folders, reusable components, state management with Zustand/Redux).

// Set him up with pair programming sessions on small tickets, explaining why we used certain patterns instead of just what to type.

// Created a mini onboarding doc that outlined our coding conventions (naming, linting rules, commit style, PR process).

// Introduced him to Storybook so he could explore reusable components instead of rebuilding things from scratch.

// Encouraged him to use PR reviews as a learning space, where I‚Äôd leave detailed comments explaining alternatives or potential pitfalls.

//* Result:
// Within a month, he was independently picking up and completing tickets. His PR rejection rate dropped significantly because he started following patterns consistently. A few months later, he was comfortable enough to mentor an intern himself.

//? How do you handle code reviews to balance speed and quality?

//* üéØ How I Handle Code Reviews (Balance Speed & Quality)

//* 1. Set Clear Expectations

// Establish standards upfront (lint rules, Prettier, TypeScript, CI tests).

// This way, reviews focus on logic, architecture, and readability, not spacing or semicolons.

//* 2. Prioritize What Matters

// ‚úÖ Correctness & security (bugs, edge cases, data validation).

// ‚úÖ Readability & maintainability (is it clear for future devs?).

// ‚úÖ Consistency with project patterns (state management, naming, API calls).

// ‚ö†Ô∏è Nitpicks (formatting, minor style) ‚Üí trust tooling or suggest politely without blocking.

// * 3. Communicate Clearly

// I give constructive, actionable feedback (e.g., ‚ÄúConsider extracting this into a custom hook for reuse‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúThis is wrong‚Äù).

// If it‚Äôs subjective, I phrase it as a suggestion: ‚ÄúOptional: you could also do it this way for clarity.‚Äù

//* 4. Keep Flow Moving

// For small PRs: respond quickly, usually within hours.

// For large PRs: if changes are needed but not critical, approve with follow-up tasks instead of blocking.

// Encourage smaller PRs to keep reviews fast.

//* 5. Lead by Example

// I write clean, self-explanatory PRs myself (descriptions, screenshots, context).

// This sets the tone that reviews aren‚Äôt adversarial ‚Äî they‚Äôre collaborative.

// * PRACTICAL EXAMPLE

// Situation: At Wema Bank, we had a tight deadline on a new React dashboard. A junior dev submitted a PR with working code, but it mixed inline styles, duplicated API calls, and lacked error handling.

// Task: I needed to review it in a way that kept us moving fast without sacrificing long-term maintainability.

// Action:

// Pointed out the critical fix (consolidating API calls and adding error handling).

// Suggested extracting UI into a reusable component instead of inline styles.

// Approved the PR after those key changes, but left notes for follow-up refactoring tickets.

// Took 10 minutes after to pair program with him on writing a reusable hook for API calls.

// Result: The feature shipped on time, the codebase stayed clean, and the junior dev learned patterns he reused later without needing reminders.

//? How do you handle disagreements with teammates or product managers?

//* In my experience, disagreements are best handled by focusing on shared goals and using data to guide decisions. For example, while redeveloping the Customer Master Data Management (CMDM) portal at Wema Bank, there was a disagreement between product managers‚Äîwho wanted features released quickly‚Äîand the dev team, who prioritized scalability and technical debt.

//* I organized a discussion where both sides presented their reasoning, then I quantified the trade-offs: showing how architectural improvements would save ‚Ç¶8M annually and improve efficiency for 500+ internal users. We agreed on a compromise‚Äîship a minimal viable feature set early, while scheduling scalability improvements for the next sprint.

//* That experience reinforced my approach: listen first, use data to depersonalize the debate, and align everyone around the business impact. This way, disagreements lead to stronger solutions rather than friction.

//? Have you ever influenced technical decisions for the team? How?

// Situation:

//* At Wema Bank, I worked on the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS), which was critical for enabling cross-border payments across multiple African countries. Initially, there was a push from leadership to house PAPSS within the existing NIPBranch codebase, since both handled financial transactions.

// Task:

//* My responsibility was to evaluate the technical and operational implications and ensure we made the best architectural decision for long-term performance, compliance, and maintainability.

// Action:

//* I carefully reviewed the proposal and highlighted several risks of combining PAPSS into the same codebase as NIPBranch:

//* Separation of concerns ‚Äì PAPSS had different compliance rules, transaction workflows, and integration points compared to NIPBranch. Mixing them in the same codebase would create unnecessary coupling and increase complexity.

//* Scalability & performance ‚Äì PAPSS was expected to handle high transaction volumes across multiple countries. Housing it inside NIPBranch risked resource contention and bottlenecks, potentially degrading performance for both systems.

//* Regulatory flexibility ‚Äì PAPSS had to adapt to evolving cross-border regulations, while NIPBranch focused on local settlement. A standalone architecture would allow faster updates without impacting NIPBranch stability.

//* Deployment independence ‚Äì Keeping PAPSS separate meant we could scale, deploy, and patch it independently without risking downtime or regression in NIPBranch.

//* Risk isolation ‚Äì A bug in PAPSS shouldn‚Äôt bring down NIPBranch (and vice versa). Decoupling reduced the blast radius of potential failures.

//* I presented these points with simulations of projected load and a simple deployment diagram to demonstrate how PAPSS could scale independently. I also explained in business terms: keeping them separate would reduce downtime risk, speed up compliance updates, and protect both systems‚Äô performance.

// Result:

//* After reviewing the risks and benefits, leadership agreed with my recommendation. PAPSS was built as a standalone project with its own architecture, services, and deployment pipeline. The outcome was a faster, more resilient platform that improved settlement speed, ensured compliance, and allowed independent scaling without impacting NIPBranch.

//! üîπ 3. Cross-Functional Collaboration

// They‚Äôll test if you can work with product managers, backend engineers, designers, and stakeholders.
// Possible questions:

//? How do you collaborate with backend engineers when designing APIs?

//* I approach API collaboration with backend engineers as a partnership where we define clear contracts that serve both the frontend experience and backend efficiency.

//* Early involvement in design ‚Äì I join discussions right from the planning stage. For example, in the fund transfer system redesign at Wema Bank, I worked closely with backend engineers to map user flows into API endpoints. This ensured the payloads included everything the UI needed, reducing the number of round trips.

//* Define contracts with examples ‚Äì We use tools like Swagger/OpenAPI or even Postman collections to define request/response formats. This allows both sides to validate edge cases early. On the CMDM portal project, I created mock responses for the frontend while backend engineers refined their services. This parallel workflow reduced development time significantly.

//* Discuss trade-offs ‚Äì I often highlight frontend performance needs (like minimizing over-fetching and under-fetching). For instance, when building the PAPSS settlement platform, I suggested paginated endpoints for large transaction logs instead of returning all records at once. This kept the UI responsive without overloading backend resources.

//* Testing and feedback loop ‚Äì Once APIs are built, I test them against real use cases and provide feedback quickly. Sometimes I‚Äôll even contribute to writing test scripts or propose refinements if I notice inconsistencies in error handling or status codes.

//* Focus on shared goals ‚Äì My mindset is not ‚Äúfrontend vs backend,‚Äù but ‚Äúwhat makes the product more efficient and user-friendly.‚Äù For example, while working on the FinTech Virtual Account Manager, we agreed on using standard HTTP status codes and descriptive error messages to reduce confusion and speed up debugging for both sides.

//* Result: This collaborative approach has consistently improved delivery speed, reduced back-and-forth rework, and led to APIs that are both robust for backend systems and ergonomic for frontend developers.

//? Describe a time you translated complex technical issues into simple terms for business leaders.

// * While redeveloping the Customer Master Data Management (CMDM) portal at Wema Bank, product leaders wanted quick feature delivery without addressing scalability. I explained in simple business terms that rushing could cause future downtime, higher costs, and delays in compliance updates. I translated the technical debt into numbers‚Äî‚Ç¶8M annual savings and faster decision-making for 500+ staff‚Äîif we invested in a modular design. This helped leadership understand the trade-off, and they approved the scalable approach. The result was a more efficient, future-ready system that satisfied both business and technical goals.

//! üîπ 4. Ownership & Impact

// ‚ÄúArchitected‚Äù implies you owned big-picture solutions.
// Possible questions:

//? Tell me about a system or feature you owned end-to-end.

// Another system I owned end-to-end was the Customer Master Data Management (CMDM) portal redevelopment at Wema Bank.

// Situation:
// *The old CMDM system was inefficient, costly to maintain, and not scalable. Business leaders wanted a faster solution for managing customer data that also supported compliance and decision-making.

// Task:
// *I was responsible for leading the frontend redevelopment, collaborating with backend, compliance, and product teams, and ensuring the solution delivered both technical and business value.

// Action:

//* I designed and implemented a modular, scalable frontend architecture to support future integrations.

//* Worked with backend engineers to define APIs that minimized over-fetching and supported advanced search and reporting.

//* Built a user-friendly interface that made data management much more intuitive for 500+ staff.

//* Partnered with compliance and security teams to ensure data governance and regulatory requirements were fully met.

//* Translated technical trade-offs into business terms for product managers, securing buy-in for long-term improvements instead of quick fixes.

// Result:

//* The new CMDM portal improved operational efficiency, saved the bank around ‚Ç¶8M annually, and empowered 500+ internal users with faster, more accurate customer data. Owning this project from design through delivery not only strengthened my technical leadership but also improved trust between engineering and business stakeholders.

//? What trade-offs did you make when designing X system?

//? How did you measure the impact of your solution?

//? If you had more time/resources, what would you improve about the architecture?

//! üîπ 5. Technical Depth

// They‚Äôll push deeper if you claim ‚Äúarchitected.‚Äù
// Possible questions:

// Why did you choose Redux vs Zustand for state management?

// How did you secure your frontends against XSS/CSRF?

// How do you handle authentication/authorization at the frontend level?

// Explain a caching strategy you implemented to improve frontend performance.

// üëâ Preparation: Be ready to dive into specific decisions you made and alternatives you considered.

// ‚úÖ Bottom line: If you use architected and led, expect interviewers to test for:

// System design thinking (scalability, performance, architecture).

// Leadership/mentorship (coaching, code reviews, influencing).

// Collaboration & communication (working across teams).

// End-to-end ownership (not just coding, but design + deployment + impact).
