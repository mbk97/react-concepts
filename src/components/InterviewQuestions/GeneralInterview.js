// ! Tell Me about yourself

// * I am a web developer with close to 4 years of professional experience. My journey began in 2021 when I joined F&K Savings as a front-end developer. There, I worked with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Styled Components, and Redux to develop the F&K Savings user dashboard, where customers could carry out transactions like savings, withdrawals, and investing in various offers.

// * After my time at F&K, I moved to Pledre, an EdTech company similar to Udemy. My primary responsibility was optimizing the existing web app by fixing bugs and implementing features such as the testimonial section, gift-a-course feature, and crowd classroom. I also developed custom landing pages for enterprise subscribers using Next.js.

// * Currently, I work at Wema Bank as a front-end developer. My role involves automating business processes and modernizing legacy applications, such as the NIP in-branch web app, ensuring smooth financial transactions. I also redeveloped the customer master data management tool, which serves as a central repository for all wema bank customer data, and this helped the bank save over 8 million naira in maintenance fees. Additionally, I was a core member of the team that redeveloped the new Wema Bank website.

//* Overall, I am passionate about creating high-quality web products that align with business needs and customer satisfaction.

// * I believe my experience and skills make me a strong candidate for this role, and I’m excited about the opportunity to bring my expertise to your team.

// ! Tell Me about your strength

// ** Communication: I ensure that all stakeholders are aligned and informed throughout the project’s lifecycle. Whether it's collaborating with team members, clients, or other departments, I make sure that expectations are clear and that everyone involved has the information they need to contribute effectively.

// ! Tell Me about your weakness

// * One of my weaknesses is that I can sometimes get too focused on the technical details of a project. While this attention to detail helps me produce high-quality work, it can occasionally lead to spending more time than necessary perfecting minor aspects, like fine-tuning the UI or optimizing performance beyond what’s needed.

// * I’ve been working on improving this by setting clearer priorities and deadlines for myself, ensuring I focus on delivering key features first and iterating as needed. I’m also learning to trust the iterative development process, allowing room for improvement over time rather than aiming for perfection in the initial phase.

// * I used to get nervous giving presentations, so I enrolled on a course to improve my public speaking.

// ! Tell me an achievement you are proud of

// ! Situation:
//**  At Wema Bank, the Customer Master Data Management (CMDM) portal was inefficient, leading to inaccurate decision-making and increased operational costs. It was critical for the bank to improve the system to streamline processes for internal users across multiple departments.

//! Task:
//* I was tasked with redeveloping the CMDM portal to enhance its performance, improve decision-making speed, and reduce operational costs for over 500 internal users.

//! Action:
//* Using React for the front-end and Zustand for state management, I developed a highly responsive system with the following key features:

//* Saved Search Filters: Implemented functionality to allow users to save custom search filters. These preferences were persisted using Zustand's local storage capabilities, enabling users to quickly apply their filters without resetting them during sessions.

// * Data Trends with Charts: Integrated Chart.js to visually represent data trends such as user activity and key performance metrics. This helped stakeholders monitor real-time data and make informed decisions.

//* Efficient User & Role Management: I implemented a user management system to ensure that features are available based on each user's access level and permissions. This helped provide secure, tailored access across the platform

//! Result:
//* The new CMDM portal significantly improved decision-making and operational efficiency, resulting in cost savings of ₦8 million. It also enhanced the experience for internal users, contributing to smoother operations across multiple departments.
