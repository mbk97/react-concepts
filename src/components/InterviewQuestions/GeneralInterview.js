// ! Tell Me about yourself

//* I'm a web developer with 4 years of experience building scalable (Building scalable frontend solutions means writing code and creating systems that are clean, reusable, performant, and flexible enough to handle more users, more features, and future updates without major rewrites) front-end solutions across FinTech, EdTech, and banking. I started out at F&K Savings, building a React-based dashboard that enabled customers to manage their savings and investments. At Pledre, I improved product experience by implementing key features and custom landing pages for enterprise clients using Next.js.

//* Currently, I work at Wema Bank, where I’ve modernized several high-impact systems—like the NIP in-branch transfer platform and a central customer data tool that saved over ₦8 million in maintenance costs. I also played a key role in launching the new Wema Bank website and developing internal portals used across compliance, audit, and FinTech operations.

// * I’m passionate about crafting solutions that align business objectives with excellent user experience, and I’m now looking to contribute at a more strategic level—bringing both technical expertise and product insight to help teams scale efficiently.".

// ! Tell Me about your strength

// ** Communication: I ensure that all stakeholders are aligned and informed throughout the project’s lifecycle. Whether it's collaborating with team members, clients, or other departments, I make sure that expectations are clear and that everyone involved has the information they need to contribute effectively.

// * User-Centric Mindset: I have a strong ability to think from the user’s perspective, which allows me to identify and resolve usability issues early. This means I pay close attention to the overall flow and experience of applications — ensuring they’re intuitive, efficient, and aligned with how real users interact with them. In environments like banking and fintech, where user trust and ease of navigation are crucial, this mindset ensures that the solutions I build are not only functional but also user-friendly and accessible.

// ! Tell Me about your weakness

// * One of my weaknesses is that I can sometimes get too focused on the technical details of a project. While this attention to detail helps me produce high-quality work, it can occasionally lead to spending more time than necessary perfecting minor aspects, like fine-tuning the UI or optimizing performance beyond what’s needed.

// * I’ve been working on improving this by setting clearer priorities and deadlines for myself, ensuring I focus on delivering key features first and iterating as needed. I’m also learning to trust the iterative development process, allowing room for improvement over time rather than aiming for perfection in the initial phase.

// * I used to get nervous giving presentations, so I enrolled on a course to improve my public speaking.
