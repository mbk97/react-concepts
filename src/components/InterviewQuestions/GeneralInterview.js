// ! Tell Me about yourself

// * I am a web developer with close to 4 years of front-end development experience. My professional journey began in 2021 when I joined F&K Savings as a front-end developer. There, I worked with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Styled Components, and Redux to develop the F&K Savings user dashboard, where customers could carry out transactions like savings, withdrawals, and investing in various offers.

// * After my time at F&K, I moved to Pledre, an EdTech company similar to Udemy. My primary responsibility was optimizing the existing web app by fixing bugs and implementing features such as the testimonial section, gift-a-course feature, and crowd classroom. I also developed custom landing pages for enterprise subscribers using Next.js.

// * Currently, I work at Wema Bank as a front-end developer. My role involves automating business processes and modernizing legacy applications, such as the NIP in-branch web app, ensuring smooth financial transactions. I also redeveloped the customer master data management tool, which helped the bank save over 8 million naira in maintenance fees. Additionally, I was a core member of the team that redeveloped the new Wema Bank website.

// * One of my key strengths is my ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams, including designers, developers, and QA engineers. I’m equally comfortable working independently and taking ownership of my projects.

//* Overall, I am passionate about creating high-quality web products that align with business needs and customer satisfaction.

// * I believe my experience and skills make me a strong candidate for this role, and I’m excited about the opportunity to bring my expertise to your team.

// ! Why should we hire you

// * You should hire me because I bring a strong combination of TECHNICAL expertise, PRACTICAL experience, and a proven track record of delivering impactful web solutions.

// * With close to 4 years of experience in web development, I’ve honed my skills in some of the top web languages and frameworks, including JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Node.js, as well as state management tools like Zustand and Redux.

// * This skill set, allows me to contribute effectively across the full stack when needed.

// * Ultimately, my passion for creating innovative and scalable web solutions, my ability to drive meaningful results, and my collaborative mindset make me a strong fit for your team.

// ! Tell Me about your strength

// * Collaboration and Communication: I’m a team player who values collaboration. I can communicate technical concepts clearly to both developers and non-developers, ensuring that everyone is on the same page.

// * Attention to Detail: Whether it’s ensuring UI responsiveness or perfecting API integrations, I’m meticulous about details. I focus on clean, maintainable code and always look to optimize performance without compromising functionality.

// * Continuous Learning and Growth: I constantly seek to learn and evolve, staying up-to-date with the latest trends in web development. This dedication to self-improvement ensures I can bring innovative solutions and best practices to every project.

// ! Tell Me about your weakness

// * One of my weaknesses is that I can sometimes get too focused on the technical details of a project. While this attention to detail helps me produce high-quality work, it can occasionally lead to spending more time than necessary perfecting minor aspects, like fine-tuning the UI or optimizing performance beyond what’s needed.

// * I’ve been working on improving this by setting clearer priorities and deadlines for myself, ensuring I focus on delivering key features first and iterating as needed. I’m also learning to trust the iterative development process, allowing room for improvement over time rather than aiming for perfection in the initial phase.

// *Previously, when managing multiple projects at the same time, I wasn’t able to remember and prioritise my tasks. To counter this, each day I created a prioritised to-do list.

// * I used to spend too much time on tasks that weren’t the highest priority. Now I’m better at allocating my time to things that deliver value to the business.

// *I used to get nervous giving presentations, so I enrolled on a course to improve my public speaking.”
